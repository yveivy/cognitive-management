# Cognitive-Management

## Description

Cognitive Management is a powerful note-taking application built on Express.js framework that allows you to effortlessly write, organize and save your important thoughts and ideas. The interface is streamlined, and makes sharing ideas with fellow collaborators a breeze.

You can create notes on any topic and conveniently save them for future reference. You'll gladly replace your outdated sticky pad, and the days of jotting down important thoughts with pen and paper. Everyone knows those sticky pad notes just end up in the laundry anyway.
